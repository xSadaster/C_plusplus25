/*Exercise 6:
Create a program using struct and switch to manage student records. The program should:
1. Use a struct Student to store a studentâ€™s name, ID, and grade.
2. Allow the user to:
(a) Add a student.
(b) Display all students.
(c) Search for a student by ID.
(d) Exit the program.
Note: struct can be
struct Student {
 char name[50];
 int id;
 float grade;
};*/
